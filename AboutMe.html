    <h2>My Bio</h2>
  <p>
    I am a soon-to-graduate information sciences and technology major with an interest 
    in learning how upcoming businesses can integrate with advancing technology. I 
    see how critical it is for a business to focus on their objectives while people 
    like me can make sure they stay up-to-date with their technology systems and 
    security. I have provided support for properties under Hershey Entertainment & 
    Resorts as well as trained a small group of new interns to be on the team with 
    me. I have also worked with a local business to make decisions about their 
    computing needs and how to budget the best options. I find my strength to be 
    unwavering determination in the face of an uncompleted project. Outside of this
    determination, I enjoy being humorous and making my peers laugh. I aim to be 
    a key part of an organization that utilizes my talents and offers me extensive
    learning opportunities.

  <h2>My Work</h2>

  <img src="Images/IMG_2377.jpg" title="My Badge" alt="A picture of Aidan's Hershey Employee Badge" height="434px" width="621px">

  <p>
    As an IT Intern for Hershey Entertainment and Resorts I was responsible for tech support, 
    equipment setup/teardown, and other technology projects at the Hersheypark, Hershey Lodge,
    and Hershey Hotel locations. In my two summers in that position I have mastered tech support 
    skills, trained new interns, and I am now looking for growth. My success in this position was 
    my ability to hold myself to professional standards as well as leading my fellow interns. 
    I am confident, understanding, and excel at customer service which would make me an excellent
    addition to your IT team.

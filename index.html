          <h2>Aidan Glas</h2>
          <p>
            I am a soon-to-graduate information sciences and technology major with an interest
            in learning how upcoming businesses can integrate with advancing technology. I see
            how critical it is for a business to focus on their objectives while people like
            me can make sure they stay up-to-date with their technology systems and security.
            I have provided support for properties under Hershey Entertainment & Resorts 
            as well as trained a small group of new interns to be on the team with me. I 
            have also worked with a local business to make decisions about their computing
            needs and how to budget the best options. I find my strength to be unwavering 
            determination in the face of an uncompleted project. Outside of this determination,
            I enjoy being humorous and making my peers laugh. I aim to be a key part of
            an organization that utilizes my talents and offers me extensive learning 
            opportunities.

  <h2>WHICH WEBSITE IS WHICH</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/abg5406/">http://personal.psu.edu/abg5406/</a>
</p>
<p>
    This site was an excellent opportunity to learn the basics of HTML and how to design an attractive and responsive 
    website. I went through Penn State's free website hosting similar to how the site you are on right now is hosted.
</p>
<p>
    The difference between the two is, my personal site linked above required an application. After a few days I was given 
    a source file for what the website displays and a number of helpful tips and regulations I had to adhere to.
</p>

    <h2><strong>THE ASSIGNMENT</strong></h2>

<p>
    Over the course of several weeks, new and diverse additions each week, the site slowly developed and now resembles
     a professional website. Below is the criteria I had for the final submission of the
      assignment.

    <h2>MY INTEREST IN WEB DESIGN</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.webfx.com/web-design/why-is-web-design-important.html">https://www.webfx.com/web-design/why-is-web-design-important.html</a></p>

<p>
    Above is a article that highlights my thoughts and interests in web design and why I am thinking about a potential 
    career in it. It talks a lot about leaving a good impression on people who visit your site and for those visiting to
     buy something. For my personal website, I am very concerned with making sure a potential employer that sees my site 
     linked on my resume and believes I am a good web designer.
</p>
<p>
    It also highlights how important it is for a website to be easy to navigate. I think that this is critical for the 
    future of web design and will be the focus point for successful websites.

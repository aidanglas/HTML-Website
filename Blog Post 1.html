    <p>In the days of stay at home orders and quarantine there are a lot of people with access to adequate technology. As an IST major
         and someone who relies on technology for work, study, and free time, I see the impact it has on those less fortunate.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, I have been researching and engaging in discussion forums on mutual aid/ mutual assistance programs. 
        These programs are more critical in a time like this where there are so many people in need of many different 
        things to keep their lives running the same way as before the pandemic.
    </p>

    <h2>MUTUAL AID</h2>

    <p>
        Technology mutual aid programs are the most critical. Working from home is the new norm for nearly everyone that has kept
         their job through the layoffs and furloughs. Those that were used to using company owned technology most likely don't 
         have the right setup at home to stay a comfortable and efficient employee. Thankfully there are many programs that assist in 
         filling the gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
        AT&amp;T for example has cut costs for international phone plans and even made free unlimited data accessible. They also offer 
        numerous tutorials on how to setup mobile hotspots and wifi calling from home. There are many others doing similar aid programs.

    <h2>MY AID PROGRAM</h2>

    <p>
        As an assignment, I wrote a plan to have my own program mean to help students and employees at home get simple access to computers and wi-fi. 
        These are the first steps to working from home. Below is my blog post from that discussion.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>COMPUTERS AND INTERNET: FOR THE STUDENT + FOR THE EMPLOYEE</strong></h3>

    <p>
        My mutual aid project focuses on getting people computers and internet access so that they can continue their usual work, but from home. 
        There are only a few steps, but the in between processes are what will take the most time and effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get people computers, a few things must be established beforehand. The person getting it must have between $100-$200 that they are willing to spend. 
        This price will get you a working computer that does the basics without trouble. After the person in need chooses the computer they want, they can be 
        linked with someone that has an available Amazon account, preferably a Prime subscription as well. The haste in computer delivery is important because
         every day without one is a day of work missed.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the person is paired with an Amazon account holder, the laptop is purchased and sent to the receivers' address and the purchaser is reimbursed.
         This is just a way for people looking to avoid a costly Prime subscription to get their computer quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        This also provides an opportunity for people who are fortunate enough and have the interest in helping others, to buy computers. There is also a collective 
        fund;that can be donated to that;will fund people who aren't able to pay the up-front cost. An application can be filled out and reviewed by
         a small group of people and the collective fund will pay for a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step is to get internet to all the new computers, or just to those looking for internet. My plan for doing this is creating a system that lets 
        people know what stores and other places are left open that offer free Wi-Fi. This will give people the opportunity to drive up and connect without having
         to leave their car. The other option for Wi-Fi is setting up phones with unlimited data plans capable of running a hotspot or using the collective fund 
         to finance data plans for people to set up more hotspots.
        </p>
    </p>
    
        <h3>WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN</h3>

    <p>
        This project will sustain itself with only a few people volunteering their time to set up the chatrooms and web forums where we connect the account 
        holders with those in need. The same people will also be the small board that decides on where the collective fund goes based on a group decision after 
        looking over applications. This leaves the two sides of the project. One side that is independently funded and the other side that pairs up those that
         can pay the up-front cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project is currently theory and might run into some trouble on the way with logistical issues. It is also built on the assumption that 
        all of these people have access to a smart device they can use to access the web forums and applications. With a goal of reaching as many 
        students and employees as possible, this project has the potential to help some people. Even if its not many, if there are a few people able
         to live an easier life as a result of our project, then it is a success.
